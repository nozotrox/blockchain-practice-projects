### ABOUT THE EXERCISE/PRACTICE PROJECT
This is an asset tokenization project built with the following use cases:
üí∞ Tokenization of any Assets as fungible Tokens (ERC20)   
üè¶ Creation of Bonus Programs, Vouchers, etc.   
üí≤ Creation of a new cryptocurrency   
üßæ Creation of a Payment-layer on top of the Ethereum  

This example project was built with the following purpose:
üß∞ Understand truffle-config JSON file
ü§ñ Understand deployment of dApps
ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Understand Tokenization using Open-Zeppelin Smart Contracts
‚òëÔ∏è Deeper dive into Unit-Testing

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started
For this project, there is a set of tools required to run the project. Follow the instructions in the following sections to get it all set up.
This project was built following [these instructions](https://ethereum-blockchain-developer.com/060-tokenization/12-metamask-deployment/). Some of the steps given here, show how to run the project.

### Prerequisites
To run the project, you'll need to have `node`(v12 or later)  & `npm` installed. 
To check if the tools have been installed, run the following commands on a terminal window:
```sh
npm -v
node -v
git --version
```
If an error or a message is displayed instead of a version output, it means you'll have to install them. You can search for how to install them on Windows & Mac. The commands shown in this section were run on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS. For Windows, you can run on a WSL terminal.
To install these tools, run the following commands (Linux):
```sh
sudo apt install node
```
```sh
sudo apt install npm
```

Also, to test this project you'll need a [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) account set up.

### Install Truffle
To install `Truffle`, run the following command:
```sh
sudo npm install -g truffle
```
This will install Truffle in your global npm directory.

### Running the project
Before starting the project, run the following commands in the `client` and `truffle` folders.
In the `client` folder, run `npm run start` to start the local react server.  
For other instructions on how to make the project work you your local machine, follow the steps on this [website](https://ethereum-blockchain-developer.com/060-tokenization/12-metamask-deployment/).   
But before, install the [ganache](https://trufflesuite.com/docs/ganache/) blockchain development network. Double-check if the network config parameters in the `/truffle/truffle-config.js` under <i>ganache_local</i> are the same provided by ganache in your system.

### Running the project on Ganacheüç´
After, installing ganache, run the following command:
```sh
truffle migrate --network ganache_local
```
The network configurations have already been added to the `truffle-config.js` file.
